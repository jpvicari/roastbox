### Farm Notes ##
This coffee comes to us from the region of Pedralva, in the Mantiqueira micro region, an area that boasts over 2000 smaller farms. At 30+ hectares each, the farm sizes aren't "small" when comparing with the small holder farms we buy from in Colombia for example. But they're small for Brazil, home to massive estates with fully mechanized harvesting operations. Many of the farmers in Pedralva still do some manual harvesting, which means more control  over separation of ripe and underripe cherry. This particular lot is from Pedra Branca, a processing facility that was erected as part of a quality-focused initiative providing the local farmers state of the art processing infrastructure where they can process smaller batch sizes. The facility is equipped to produce both pulp-natural and dry-processed coffees, this being the latter. The farms are located around the Pedra Branca mountians, plantings in the 1300 meter range and planted mainly in Red and Yellow Bourbon and Catuai. We found that the cup profile tastes the most settled with at least 48 hours.

### Cupping Notes ##
City+ and Full City roasts harness robust cocoa roast flavors that are matched by unrefined, date syup-like sweetness. The aroma offers a banana bread and a rummy, sweet smell. The brewed cup has bittersweetness you expect from Brazil, underlying chocolate accents with countering molasses and rustic palm sugar sweetness. After cooling a bit a dusty berry note comes through (like freeze dried fruit), though not so much in Full City+ roasts. Deep, chocolatey bass notes keep the coffee profile grounded at a wide range of roast levels. With Brazils I like to use a more gradual roast curve in order to boost the cacao/roast tone character while avoiding ashy flavors that might come with roasting a soft coffee too fast. If you have manual heat control, try pulling back on your heat input 10F degrees before 1st crack and adjust from there. Once again Pedra Branca is at the top of our list of Brazil SO espresso, and can also be used to as a body/bittersweet component for an espresso blend base.

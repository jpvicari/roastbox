### Farm Notes ##
Pantan Musara is a high elevation region in Aceh Province, South Takengon. The coffee is made up of small-holders in the region who belong to a coffee cooperative called "Ribang Gayo Musara Cooperative". One unique aspect of this particular Sumatran coffee coop, is that they focus on processes like fully washed, natural and honey rather than the traditional wet-hulled that you mostly find from Sumatra. There's a greater financial return on these process methods, at least for the time being. They've refined their technique, each lot of coffee undergoing extensive hand sorting in order to prepare to grade 1 standards. The coop has also build large drying domes with both raised beds and patio space to dry their coffee. Farm altitude in this region starts at 1500 meters on the low end and tops out around 1700 meters above sea level.

### Cupping Notes ##
The smell of the dry, ground coffee has raw sugar and vanilla, along with some more typical "wet hulled" root-y notes and wood spices. The wet aroma brings out enticing raw cane sugar sweetness in the steam, and herbal hints. The brewed coffee has a spiced-vanilla sweetness, and the flavor notes touch on root beer soda, with an earth-toned burdock root accent. "Foresty" is an adjective that came to mind when drinking a pour-over of Pantan Musara, and in many ways, it harnesses the best of both wet process and wet hulled flavors. This woodsy notes have pine-like aroma that sits atop dark corn syrup sweetness, and clean acidity with elements of citrus peel. I found myself thinking of wet process Sulawesi coffee when brewing light roasts. Full City+ roasting suits this coffee too, and the cup is so different than at City+. Roast flavors are delicious and intense in the brew, with the complexity of a high % dark chocolate bar.

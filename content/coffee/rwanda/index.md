### Farm Notes ##
Gitesi is one of my favorite sites in Rwanda. Not only is it located in a beautiful valley, but the washing station is always so clean, well-organized and the leaders seemed motivated and competent. I had already cupped quite a few day lots (wet-process batches from coffee cherry received in a single day) and I knew the coffee was really good from the previous years we purchased this coffee. The Gitesi site is at 1740 meters, actually one of the lower areas surrounded by high ridges ranging up to 2000 meters where coffee is grown. More than 1,800 coffee farmers in the area supply Gitesi with cherries each year. The station fosters a relationship with the farmers by paying an additional dividend at the end of each season based on performance. Gitesi was started in 2005 and has been building capacity with each passing harvest. Like much of Rwanda, the coffee is Bourbon variety. We "built" this lot by looking at all their day lot batches and combining the best ones. We found some excellent process batches from the middle harvest. Gitesi has placed at COE ("Cup of Excellence") more than once, including top coffee a few years back, and  continues to produce competition level coffees.

### Cupping Notes ##
Gitesi continues to produce some of the best coffee we see from the region. From the outset, the ground coffee presents an attractive fragrance perfumed with clover honey and spiced, tea-like accents that are complex and delicate. Aspects of complex sugar browning come into view when you add the hot water, with sweet smells of caramel candy and a sweetened black tea note. City roasts show a framework of raw sugar sweetness making up the underlying flavor compound, like sugarcane juice. As you move through the cup, black and green tea flavors come up in the profile, as well as a mandarin orange accent note that lends some 'zip' to the acidic impression. Gitesi's finish is marked by brisk apple and tea-like flavors when roasted light. Darker roasting builds flavor layers of fine dark chocolates and a red berry hint. The sweetness is uncompromising at all roast levels we tried, but for the most delicate cups, don't stretch it beyond City+. Gitesi makes a fantastic pour over brew, and the more developed roasts double nicely as a spiced, chocolatey espresso.

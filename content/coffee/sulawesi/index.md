### Farm Notes ##
This lot comes to us by way of a small scale coffee collector who lives in Pulu Pulu village, within the Sapan Distric of Sulawesi. While he may not be a local himself, he married one, and has deep ties to the coffee farmers in this small coffee growing region, and some of the surrounding regions as well. This coffee is from two areas in Sapan, Parandangan & Paonganan. A lot of the coffee trees are older Typica and Timor hybrid types, and the elevation is around 1700 to 2000 meters above sea level. Farmers depulp their own coffee and then sell to the collector as wet parchment. He then peels the coffee down to the seed, and lays it to dry at his small warehouse in Pulu Pulu. This is the traditional wet hulled method, something you just don't see in other parts of the world, and produces rustic, big bodied, and incredibly complex cups.

### Cupping Notes ##
Cupping Sapan alongside other wet hulled coffees, I found it showed a nice mixture of cleaner, brown sugar-type sweetness, as well as the complex herbal and earthy aromatics you might expect. I picked up on accent flavors candied yam, overripe banana, and a kind of wood pulp sweetness that reminded me of chewing sugar cane. It's not often we taste a wet hulled coffee with acidity either, but Sapan rises to the occasion with citrus-like tartness that adds acidic structure to the complex flavor profile, and underlines an accent note of orange pith. Sapan works really well at Full City+ roast level too. The intense sweetness proves to be resilient to 2nd Crack, layered with rich, dark cacao flavors, and an earthy fig note in the finish.
